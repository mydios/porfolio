# Dylan Van Parys

## About me
Hey, I'm a **software engineer with industry experience**. I enjoy working with various technologies and using my engineering background to solve challenging problems. 

I graduated cum laude from Ghent University in 2021 with a MSc in **Computer Science Engineering**.

After getting my first **2+ years** of experience as an IT consultant I am now looking for my next experience as an independent **IT consultant on contract basis**.
